<p>Within the relatively short and prestigious list of classic films in history there are few that changed the course of cinema, and this week’s Italian masterpiece “Bicycle Thieves” ("Ladri di biciclette” also known as “The Bicycle Thief”) is one of those rare beacons. Not all classics have aged well, but this jewel remains just as enthralling and profound as the day it was first released. Its unflinchingly realistic look at a down-and-out man and his son took the world by storm and still holds the power to elicit deep emotion from even the most jaded moviegoer. </p>

        <p>Typecasting isn't something limited to actors. It most definitely applies to film genres as well, and throughout the history of cinema the science fiction film has generally been thought of by film critics and “serious” filmgoers as a lesser genre. It’s understandable because for years, particularly during the genre’s Golden Age in the 1950s, sci-fi films were almost exclusively B-movies with low-budgets, no movie stars, no impressive sets, no topnotch scripts, and they frequently flaunted cheesy-looking monsters and aliens. But even with these limitations, groundbreaking, imaginative, and highly entertaining sci-fi films were produced and this week’s classic, “The Incredible Shrinking Man”, is one of that decade’s best and most profitable. This surprisingly profound film is as close to being about the human soul as I’ve ever come across in a movie. It is also colossally fun.

<p>Some classic films contain messages, others provoke thought, quite a few explore the art of filmmaking, and many induce heartfelt emotion. Then there are those that are made simply to entertain, and one of the best of these is “North by Northwest”. Nearly perfect in every way, its glowing stars, smooth look, riveting story, and spellbinding action easily distract from the fact that this is one consummately crafted film. Directed by Alfred Hitchcock, one of the top filmmakers in history, this film is often cited as the quintessential example of his work and among his best films. “North by Northwest” is so good that the American Film Institute rated it the 4th Most Thrilling and the 40th Greatest American Movie of All-Time, the British Film Institute named it the 53rd Greatest Film of All-Time, and Cahiers du cinéma chose it as the 28th Top Film ever made. It was also nominated for three Academy Awards. “North by Northwest” offers 136 minutes of non-stop exhilaration. </p>

        <p>“Gentleman’s Agreement” was Hollywood’s first and most impactful exploration of antisemitism. It won over fifty awards including a Best Picture Oscar, Best Picture Golden Globe, and New York Film Critics Circle Award, and its success opened the door for deeper looks at topics often swept under the rug in America. As the film’s director Elia Kazan wrote in his autobiography, “A Life”: “Chosen by the critics, hailed by opinion makers, a box office winner, it provoked many statements about the movies’ finally coming of age. It was repeatedly pointed out that here the word ‘Jew’ was used for the first time in a major Hollywood film”. Over the past decades this absorbing tale has become relatively forgotten and is sometimes criticized for overstating its point. Overstated or not, it remains a highly gripping, emotionally powerful, and eye-opening film, and once again finds itself achingly relevant with today’s growing awareness of cultural prejudice. With surprises that keep unfolding from start to finish, this beautifully made and enthralling social drama is one you definitely don’t want to miss.</p>

<p>Please don’t be afraid when a silent film comes along on this blog. If you skip over them you’ll be denying yourself the immense pleasure and surprise of watching some of the best films ever made, and this week’s masterpiece “Metropolis” is one of those prime treasures you don’t want to miss. Colossal sets, groundbreaking special effects, and a literal cast of thousands come together so extraordinarily, that this film contains some of cinema’s most iconic images and perhaps its most astounding use of production design. There is nothing else like “Metropolis”. </p>
