<p class="g">Avid readers and writers don’t just spend their time buried in novels. They can also be found on literature blogs discussing book summaries and reviews, grammar and style questions, and sharing writing tips. But they don’t all end up at the same place. These book and writing blogs often split into fiction or nonfiction. </p>

            <p class="g">Since DIY projects require plenty of steps, blogging is a useful outlet to communicate with readers. In the communication process, make sure you are very organized and linear. To do that, incorporate videos and many step-by-step photos to help visual learners follow. Happy Bankky Crafty Mom did this successfully by seamlessly embedding her YouTube channel videos into her blog posts.</p>

            <p class="g">Food blogs come in several flavors. On the one hand, there’s the food critics, who go from one restaurant table to the next, tasting different dishes and narrating their experiences. On the other hand, there’s the cooking and baking enthusiasts. They document their recipes—from the ingredients they use to the steps they follow—and share them with their communities through articles, photos and videos.</p>

            <p class="g">When you begin a film blog, consider choosing a movie genre such as rom-coms, horror movies or classical movies, as Jay's Classic Movie Blog has done. In Jay's blog, you'll notice he followed the best practice of using many images. After all, film lovers are visual people, so keep them engaged with videos and rich photos on these types of blogs.</p>

            <p class="g">Before planning a trip, we tend to do a lot of research on both Google and social media. Therefore, the demand for reading other people's travel reviews is high. If you’re a globetrotter, consider this type of outlet. You can start with an insider’s guide on places to explore near you, offering reasons to visit your very own hometown, region or country.</p>
