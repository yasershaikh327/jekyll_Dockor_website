<p>James Clear's Atomic Habits is an international bestseller, offering a reasoned and insightful guide to building long-term habits. I had wanted to read this book since it began to gain critical recognition, especially as habit-forming is something I am always trying to improve upon in my own life. When I saw the audiobook was offered free as part of my Spotify subscription, I could not wait to stick my headphones in and tune into what I had been led to believe was a brilliant book. And it certainly did not disappoint.</p>

        <p>For my 21st birthday present, my sister bought me a ticket to Fern Cotton's Happy Place Festival. It was held on the grounds of Tatton Park, an historic estate in Knutsford, Cheshire. Surrounded by green woodland and blue skies, it was a precious day filled with fun, conversation, and happiness.</p>

<p>The first book I read in August was Olufemi's compelling and impressive examination of the systems that deliberate, subjugate, persecute and discriminate against women, non-binary and trans women. The book outlines the vast scope of gendered oppression, considering topics including state violence, reproductive injustice, transmisogyny, gendered Islamophobia, consumerism and so much more.

    For all the devastating reflections on the reality of injustice, there is also so much hope in Olufemi's words. Hope that change is possible, that an equal society for all can be reached, through deploying an empowering feminism. Olufemi's ideas are considered, rich and powerful. It was a privilege to read.</p>

        <p>Gunty’s novel revolves around the residents in a low-cost housing complex in Vacca Vale, Indiana. It is described as ‘a piercing look at the power structures that shape us, and the tale of a young woman with irrepressible strength’. She was shortlisted alongside Eloghosa Osunde with Vagbonds! and Bonnie Garmus with Lessons in Chemistry.


            Bea Carvalho, Head of Fiction at Waterstones, described it as having ‘the feel of the next great American novel: it is an exquisite, triumphant book which at once recalls the very best of the contemporary canon, while remaining fiercely original and innovative’. 
            
            
            Congratulations Tess Gunty!

<p>A few weekends ago, I visited Stanfords, a book store located just off the beaten track of Covent Garden in London, on Mercer Walk. Being a curious explorer and traveller and passionate reader, I have wanted to pay the shop a visit for a long time. My first trip did not disappoint. </p>
