<p>When it’s come to play food, Pizza was one of my kids favorite in their little kitchen. I used to make the pizza topping separately but Ooh boy it’s not that fun when it’s time to put it away…to make this pizza clean up friendly I decided to stitch everything in place!</p>

These Mugs such an amazing addition to their kitchen it holds shape pretty well. My kids were so excited to get their own color mugs with coffee, hot chocolate even green tea and of cause with whipping cream! They can have tea parties, play "restaurant," or "bakery," and serve all of their family p>

        <p>Today I made cardboard toaster for my little chef then I decided to cover the cardboard with felt and whip stitch the whole thing also I give a little detail on the front, moveable button, and lever inside the toaster to make the slices of bread pop out!

            It's taken me about 4 hours from start to finish. in my opinion Hand stitch really make the toaster stand out I Love the hand made looks but the most important it's make me feel special to be able to make toys for my kids to play.... at the end my kids have fun and I have something to do </p>
